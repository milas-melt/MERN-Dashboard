# Refresher of MERN apps

Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cPCMIuDk2I) MERN dashboard tutorial.

## Improvements:

-   Open/Close animations on Sidebar
-   Add requirements on models (Look at comment of server/client/models/Product.js for example)
-   In the controllers, improve error handling by catching more specific errors and sending more detailed messages for debug
-   @ `/client/src/scenes/customers/index.jsx`, change phone number REGEX (now only adapted to USA phone number formatting)

### not important improvements

-   @ `client/src/scenes/products/index.jsx`, add some loading animation or something fancy
